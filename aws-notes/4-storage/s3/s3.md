# S3 

## Distributed Object Store
Distributed data store with a large number of machines connected over a network 
Data is managed as objects, hence called object store 

Object store
- unique ID (key)
- metadata describing the content 
    - date of last modification
    - size
    - owner
    - type
    ...
- content itself 


## Use Cases
Basic Use Casess
- Store and deliver static website content 
- Store and deliver user-generated content 
- Store structrued data for analytics, data lake 

Integrate S3 into the application
- Allow a user to upload a profile picture (store in S3 and make it publicly accessible)
- Generate reports and make them accessible to users (if user wants to download, fetch from S3)
- Share data between applications (application A can write an object and application B can download and analyze)

Provide data backup and storage for other services 

Note S3 is an eventually consistent object store. Consider this if integrating into your applications and processes 

Host applicaiton installers that clients can download 


## Data Consistency 
- Create objects 
read-after-writer consistency for PUTs of new objects in the bucket 
- Update/delete objects 
Eventual consistency for overwite PUTs and DELETEs in the bucket 


## Bucket
A bucket is a container for objects 

Key are stored in alphabetical order in an index. Key name determines which partition the key is stored in
Using a / in the key acts like creating a folder for your object 

Region
- optimize latency and regulatory requirements 
- objects stored in a region never leave the region unless you explicitly transfer the data 


## CLI 
configure
add user to group with s3 access 

$ aws configure

see s3 buckets 
$ aws s3 ls 

create a bucket 
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket sample_name --region us-east-1

make a bucket with a globally unique name 
$ aws mb s3://abc-bucket

sync a local folder to s3 
$ aws s3 sync /Users/xx/ s3://abc-bucket/backup
$ aws s3 cp /Users/xx/filename.txt s3://abc-bucket/backup/samplename.txt

download from the s3 to local folder
$ aws s3 cp --recursive s3://aws-bucket/backup /Users/xx/

remove bucket and cleaup 
$ aws rb --force s3://abc-bucket 

Add a hash prefix to each object to increase throughput with S3 


## SDK
SDKs enable the following programmatically 
- List buckets and objects 
- CRUD objects and buckets
- Manage access to objects

## Security 
In transit (SSL/TLS)
- protecting data in transit 

At rest
- protecting data in disk in AWS data centers 
- server-side encryption (encrypt before saving it on disks in S3 servers)
    - using S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS-managed keys
    - objects before encryption enabled will not be encrypted 
    - once download decrypted 
- client-side encryption (encrypt before sending over to S3)
    - implemented via AWS SDK 

enable default encryption for cross-region replication 

Access to S3 Data Objects
- recommended S3 bucket policy on bucket level
- ACL (Access Control List) to grant access to individual objects
    - read object allows grantee to read the object 
    - read object permissions allows grantee to read the object ACLs
    - write object permissions allows grantee to edit permissions
- Can generate policy in the AWS JSON policy generator


## Log
cloud trail
- actions taken by a user on a resource
- who or what took which aciton 
- using Athena with CloudTrail logs can enable analysis of AWS service activity 
    - create table using the cloudtrail log s3 location


## CloudFront and S3 Transfer Acceleration
- S3 transfer acceleration 
    - users can upload files around the world
    - usews CloudFront on the backend 
    - edge location - after user downloads a file, the file will be cached in the edge location 
- AWS CloudFront is CDN offered by AWS 



# Glacier 

Archive objects that have been stored on S3 to reduce storage costs 

Management -> Lifecycle -> Add Lifecycle Rule 
- Select transition to Amazon Glacier 
- Days after object creation 

Restore from Glacier to S3
